**Understanding Chinese Diaspora through Churches: Sentimental Analysis of Chinese Migrants’ Oral Interview Transcripts in San Diego and Tucson**

This research project analyzes twenty-eight oral interviews of Chinese migrants to San Diego and Tucson in the first half of the twentieth century to investigate how mission churches in the borderlands contributed to the migrants’ survival and thriving. Employing topic modeling and sentiment analysis, this project aims to answer two questions. First, how did the mission churches give impacts on the Chinese migrants’ lives? Put another way, what did the churches do to the Chinese migrants? To address this question, I used topic modeling to categories mission churches’ services and actions related to the Chinese migrants. My second question is: How did the Chinese migrants comment on the role(s) of mission churches in their diasporic lives? For this question, I engaged sentiment analysis to evaluate and get an overview of emotional values when the Chinese migrants talked about local mission churches.
